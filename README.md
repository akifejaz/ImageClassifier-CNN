# ImageClassifier-CNN
This project is an implementation of an image classification model using machine learning techniques. The goal of the model is to classify images into different categories, such as animals, vehicles, and landscapes.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

## Model
The model used in this project is a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a type of deep learning model that is particularly well-suited for image classification tasks. The architecture of the model consists of several convolutional layers, followed by max pooling layers, and finally, fully connected layers. The model is implemented using the Keras library.

## Training
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. The training is done for 50 epochs.

## Evaluation
The model is evaluated on the test dataset, and the accuracy achieved is about 80%.

## Usage
To use the model, you will need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

1. NumPy
2. TensorFlow
3. Keras

You can then use the following command to classify an image:
```
python predict.py --image path/to/image
```

## Future Work
This model can be improved by using a larger and more diverse dataset, as well as by experimenting with different model architectures and hyperparameter settings. Furthermore, the model can be fine-tuned with transfer learning techniques to improve its performance on specific tasks.

## Contributing
If you have an idea for improving the model, please feel free to open an issue or make a pull request.
